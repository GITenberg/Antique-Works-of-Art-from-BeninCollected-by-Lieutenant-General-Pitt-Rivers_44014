<span class="smaller">WEST AFRICA.</span></h2>

<p>OBTAINED BY THE PUNITIVE EXPEDITION IN 1897, AND NOW
IN GENERAL PITT RIVERS’S MUSEUM AT FARNHAM, DORSET.</p>


<p>Benin is situated on the Guinea Coast, near the mouth of the Niger, in latitude 6·12
north, and longitude 5 to 6 east.</p>

<p>It was discovered by the Portuguese at the end of the fourteenth or commencement
of the fifteenth centuries. The Portuguese were followed by the Dutch and
Swedes, and in 1553 the first English expedition arrived on the coast, and established
a trade with the king, who received them willingly.</p>

<p>Benin at that time appears by a Dutch narrative to have been quite a large city,
surrounded by a high wall, and having a broad street through the centre. The
people were comparatively civilized. The king possessed a number of horses which
have long since disappeared and become unknown. Faulkner, in 1825, saw three
solitary horses belonging to the king, which he says no one was bold enough to ride.</p>

<p>In 1702 a Dutchman, named Nyendaeel, describes the city, and speaks of the
human sacrifices there. He says that the people were great makers of ornamental
brass work in his day, which they seem to have learnt from the Portuguese. It
was visited by Sir Richard Burton, who went there to try to put a stop to human
sacrifices, at the time he was consul at Fernando Po. In 1892 it was visited by
Captain H. L. Galloway, who speaks of the city as possessing only the ruins of its
former greatness; the abolition of the slave trade had put a stop to the prosperity
of the place, and the king had prohibited any intercourse with Europeans. The town
had been reduced to a collection of huts, and its trade had dwindled down to almost
nil. The houses have a sort of impluvium in the centre of the rooms, which has led
some to suppose that their style of architecture may have been derived from the
Roman colonies of North Africa.</p>

<p>In 1896 an expedition, consisting of some 250 men, with presents and merchandise,
left the British settlements on the coast, and endeavoured to advance towards
Benin city. The expedition was conducted with courage and perseverance, but with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
the utmost rashness. Almost unarmed, neglecting all ordinary precautions, contrary to
the advice of the neighbouring chiefs, and with the express prohibition of the King
of Benin to advance, they marched straight into an ambuscade which had been
prepared for them in the forest on each side of the road, and as their revolvers were
locked up in their boxes at the time, they were massacred to a man with the
exception of two, Captain Boisragon and Mr. Locke, who, after suffering the utmost
hardships, escaped to the British settlements on the coast to tell the tale.</p>

<p>Within five weeks after the occurrence, a punitive expedition entered Benin, on
18th January, 1897, and took the town. The king fled, but was afterwards brought
back and made to humiliate himself before his conquerers, and his territory annexed
to the British crown.</p>

<p>The city was found in a terrible state of bloodshed and disorder, saturated with
the blood of human sacrifices offered up to their Juju, or religious rites and customs,
for which the place had long been recognised as the “city of blood.”</p>

<p>What may be hereafter the advantages to trade resulting from this expedition
it is difficult to say, but the point of chief interest in connection with the subject
of this paper was the discovery, mostly in the king’s compound and the Juju houses,
of numerous works of art in brass, bronze, and ivory, which, as before stated, were
mentioned by the Dutchman, Van Nyendaeel, as having been constructed by the
people of Benin in 1700.</p>

<p>These antiquities were brought away by the members of the punitive expedition
and sold in London and elsewhere. Little or no account of them could be given by
the natives, and as the expedition was as usual unaccompanied by any scientific
explorer charged with the duty of making inquiries upon matters of historic and
antiquarian interest, no reliable information about them could be obtained. They
were found buried and covered with blood, some of them having been used amongst
the apparatus of their Juju sacrifices.</p>

<p>A good collection of these antiquities, through the agency of Mr. Charles Read,
F.S.A., has found its way into the British Museum; others no doubt have fallen into
the hands of persons whose chief interest in them has been as relics of a sensational
and bloody episode, but their real value consists in their representing a phase of art&mdash;and
rather an advanced stage&mdash;of which there is no actual record, although
no doubt we cannot be far wrong in attributing it to European influence, probably
that of the Portuguese some time in the sixteenth century.</p>

bell on neck. Dagger in sheath on right side, and various
appurtenances hanging from his dress. He holds a narrow leaf-shaped

the same form as that of the central figure. Above are two figures, one
blowing what appears to be a musical instrument and the other carrying
a barbed pointed implement, and armed with a sword in sheath similar to
that of the fallen warrior. The plaque appears to represent a victory of
some kind, and all the conquerors have the same high helmet. The ground
is ornamented with the usual foil ornament incised.</p>

<p>De Bry, “India Orientalis,” says that in the sixteenth century both the king and
chiefs were wont to ride side-saddle upon led horses. They were supported by retainers,
who held over their heads either shields or umbrellas, and accompanied by a band of
musicians playing on ivory horns, gong-gongs, drums, harps, and a kind of rattle.</p></div>

requires experience to understand their meaning. On this tusk the interlaced
pattern is the prevailing ornament, and it passes into the guilloche
pattern. This tusk is more tastefully decorated than the other tusk,
Figs. <a href="#Figs_167_and_168">167 and 168</a>, Plate XXVI, but with less variety in the carving. These
carved tusks are said to represent gods in the Ju-ju houses.</p>

<p class="description"><a id="Figs_66_to_72"></a>Figs. 66 to 72.&mdash;The historic mace of office of Duboar, late King of Benin; 5 feet
4 inches long, and made of brass. This was found by an officer of the
expedition in the state apartment of the palaver house, and was evidently
left behind by the king’s people on account of its heavy weight, in their
hurried exodus from Benin city; the king is said to have since recognized
this staff, and stated that it had been handed down for many hundreds of
years from king to king. It has the representation of “Overami,” or
reigning monarch, on the summit, dressed in the usual manner of Benin
warriors. He is standing on an elephant which has a proboscis terminating
in a human hand. This peculiarity is represented very often in the bronze
antiquities of the Benin country, and especially on the carved tusk, Figs.
<a href="#Figs_167_and_168">167 and 168</a>, Plate XXVI, and must probably represent some great fetish;
the present race, on enquiries being made, could not elucidate this matter, so
its history must date back many ages. This elephant is in turn supported
by the usual two royal leopards. The monarch holds in his right hand his
chief ju-ju, which never leaves him night or day; in his left hand he holds
a neolithic or stone axe head, edge upwards, which are looked up to by the
natives even now with great awe and superstition. The interior of the
upper part of the mace is hollow, having a piece of metal inside, formed like
a long crotal, and was used as a bell to keep order. The broad leaf-shaped
swords and the execution swords are depicted in several places over the
mace. It is ornamented with guilloche pattern of two and three bands
with intervening pellets. Part of the mace is ornamented in imitation of
twine binding. Near the foot of the staff is the figure of another elephant
with proboscis terminating in a human hand, holding a plant like a prickly-pear.
Beneath the elephant are two human figures, with Maltese crosses on
breasts, axes in left hands, and sticks in right. Below this are two axes
hafted in serpents’ heads, which have human hands in their mouths and
sinuous bodies. Crocodile, head downwards, and two interlaced mud-fish.</p>

represented on each side. Crotals are attached to the sistrum on both

with interlaced strap-work. This object appears certainly to be a sistrum,
as human figures are shown in some of the plaques holding them in their
hands and striking them with a rod to produce a sound. A similar

bird, picking at the figures of extended skeletons. In the intervals
between the other figures are oval holes with raised edges, probably a
degenerate representation of the coiled mud-fish so frequently shown in
other Benin antiquities. The fastening end of the necklace is broken,
disclosing the fact that the core of the object is of some lighter material
encased in copper or bronze. It has a hinge on one side, probably to
facilitate the opening of it.</p>

it has two elongated crotals in the upper end, with long slits for the emission
of the sound, enclosing loose rods of iron. Between the slits are vertical
bands of guilloche pattern with raised edges, similar to those represented
on the stem and top of the mancala board, Fig. <a href="#Fig_116">116</a>, Plate XX, and a
horizontal band of guilloche pattern with pellets in relief. On the top is
an upright human hand, holding a curled mud-fish. The middle of the
staff is ornamented by curious nondescript figures alternating with balls,
and the lower end has an oblong butt ornamented on the four sides with
guilloche pattern, like that of the crotals on the upper end. The staff has
been broken in the middle and mended by recasting in a clumsy way, the
metal of the part introduced being thicker than the staff itself.</p>

<p class="description"><a id="Figs_232_to_234"></a>Figs. 232 to 234.&mdash;Bronze statuette, representing a figure standing; with broad leaf-shaped
sword, similar to Figs. <a href="#Figs_326_and_327">326, 327</a>, <a href="#Figs_328_and_329">328 and 329</a>, having a twisted ring
pommel in right hand, and a sistrum in left hand. Coral choker, badge of
rank. Three tribal marks over each eye. Agate head-dress, similar to
Fig. <a href="#Fig_121">121</a>, Plate XXI, and curved agate pendants on each side. A large
twisted ring rises out of the head-dress, which looks as if intended to
enclose some thick band of cloth or other substance to suspend it. The
crown of the head-dress terminates in a thick cylindrical spike with a flat
top, like Fig. <a href="#Fig_111">111</a>, Plate XIX, Fig. <a href="#Figs_155_to_157">155</a>, Plate XXV, and Figs. <a href="#Figs_167_and_168">167 and 168</a>,
Plate XXVI. The sistrum is ornamented with a full-length human figure,
holding a staff in right hand and the so-called key or axe in left hand.
Beneath the bowl of the sistrum are three projecting cruciform bars, and
the upper edge of the bowl is ornamented on each side with two heads very
rudely cast. Dr. Felix Roth, in the “Halifax Naturalist,” June, 1898,
p. 33, speaks of these projecting prongs as being used for killing victims
for sacrificial purposes, but the fact of their being sistri is shown in connection
with Fig. <a href="#Fig_181">181</a>, Plate XXVII. Sinuous serpents cover the shaft and
bowl of the sistrum. The leaf-shaped sword is ornamented, front and back,
with small imitations of itself. The figure has bands, probably of coral,
crossing on the breast. The skirt is ornamented with conventionalized
human heads with long hair and rows of guilloche pattern. Ankles have
coral anklets. The skirt is bound up in the usual manner in a band behind
the left shoulder. There is a band of small bells round the hips, and a
human head and a bunch of bells on the left side. This figure was obtained
from the Liverpool Museum, in the report of which it is elaborately
described and figured with three others like it. “Bulletin of the Liverpool
Museums,” Vol. I, No. 2, p. 59. There is a figure like this in the British
Museum. It is of considerable weight, being cast solid.</p>

<p class="description"><a id="Figs_235_and_236"></a>Figs. 235 and 236.&mdash;Bronze figure of a native, holding what appears to be a flint-lock
gun, but the hammer of the lock is broken off. The stock is
ornamented with a debased human head. The figure has a leopard’s skin
on front and back, tail and hind legs of which are shown behind; the tail
terminates in a square bell. Sword in sheath on right side and a dagger
under the arm on left side, with small bags on both sides. There is a row
of eighteen cartridges in the waist-belt in front. The cartridges appear to
be stuck upright into sockets in the belt. A curved horn powder-flask is
on the belt on the left side. Pleated kilt below waist-belt. On the ground,
touching the feet, is a decapitated head and nine large pellets, perhaps
cannon balls. The pedestal ornamented with interlaced strap-work,
alternating with oval figures, in character resembling the ornament on the
stock of the gun. It stands on a framework of curved bars, now broken.
The breeches are ornamented with vertical rows of circles. Although this
figure holds a flint-lock gun, it is undoubtedly a native, as three tribal
marks are shown above each eye. The face is also prognathic. The head-dress
seems to be of a woven material.</p>

heads, birds and animals, carved on the surface, and also of degenerate
elephants’ heads, the proboscis, in each case, terminating in a human hand
holding a palm branch; horses’ heads; tortoises; leopards, &amp;c.; all of the
most conventionalized forms. Bands of crotals are carved at each end of
the armlet. The armlet consists of two halves connected by a thin brass
plate and copper rivets on one side and on the other by copper fastenings.
The plate is ornamented by a floral guilloche pattern, similar to that on the
central band of Fig. <a href="#Fig_140">140</a>, on the wands, Figs. <a href="#Figs_204_to_209">209</a> and <a href="#Figs_210_and_211">211</a>, and elsewhere.
This pattern is figured by Messrs. Read and Dalton in the “Journ. Anthrop.
Inst.,” Vol. XXVII, Plate XXII. The carved figures represented on this
ivory armlet are of much greater rudeness than those on the bronze objects
generally. Much weathered and probably very old.</p>

relief. Each panel has a circle with radiating lines, bounded by lines of
guilloche pattern. The several panels are separated by broad bands of
interlaced strap-work, deeply carved. The interlaced strap-work varies in
design, some being simply plaited, and in others it is further complicated
with twists and returns. Some have two interlaced bands, others four.
The carving is irregular and traced by the eye without measure or T-square.
Long sinuous snakes with heads are represented in the smaller lines
dividing the panels and give the effect of a meander. The whole of the
carving has originally been covered with thin plates of brass or bronze
beaten on, traces of which are seen here and there fastened on with oblong
rivets of metal.</p>

with figures of men and animals. On the top is a pointed spike of wood,
5 inches in height, on which the head of the victim appears to have rested,
and below this on the surface at the top of the block are two receptacles for
the thumbs of the victim, in the form of coiled mud-fish. The ornamentation
on the top consists of squares and triangles filled with parallel
straight lines alternating in direction, and edged with a circle of broken
guilloche pattern. On the sides are three human figures, two of which are
holding hands upwards, weapons and shields, and one a curved sword of
European form, point downwards. Between these figures are two boxes or
stools; there are also two human hands and other objects on the other side.
The bottom of the block is surrounded by a broad guilloche pattern of four
or five strands. The stand on which the block stands is of semicircular
form. The top is ornamented with two animals, resembling crocodiles,
conforming to the outline of the curve, and other animals and objects. On
the front of this stand is a row of objects, consisting, in the centre, of a
human figure holding something on the abdomen, human hands, animals’
heads, and other objects. A very similar execution block, but without
stand, is shown in Figs. <a href="#Figs_258_to_260">258 to 260</a>, Plate XXXIV. The barbarous carving
and ornamentation of such gruesome objects is quite characteristic of
Benin art.</p>

<p>1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.</p>

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.</p>

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.</p>

<h3>Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

<h3>Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a></p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

<h3>Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
